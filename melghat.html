            • At the northern extreme of the Amravati district of Maharashtra, on the border of Madhya Pradesh, lies the Melghat in the South-western Satpura mountain ranges. Melghat means 'meeting of the ghats', which describes the area as a large tract of unending hills and ravines scarred by jagged cliffs and steep climbs.
            
            <b>The Melghat area was declared a tiger reserve in 1974. </b>The Meghat Tiger Reserve divided into Sipna, Gugamal and Akot Wildlife Division, administratively. Presently, the total area of the reserve is around 1677 km2. In Sipna and Gugamal Wildlife Division, there are more than 10 villages in the core area. In Akot wildlife Division, there are no villages in core area. All villages are rehabilitated in akot wildlife division.
            
            The forest is tropical dry deciduous in nature, dominated by teak (Tectona grandis). The reserve is a catchment area for five major rivers: the Khandu, Khapra, Sipna, Gadga and Dolar. These all rivers are tributaries of the river Tapti.
