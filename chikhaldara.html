       <b>• Chikhaldara </b>is a hill station and a municipal council in the Amravati district in the Indian state of Maharashtra.

Chikaldhara, literally translates from Marathi to mud stream/falls (chikal + dhara). Hindus claim that this place was featured in the epic of the Mahabharata; it is where Bheema killed the villainous Keechaka in a herculean bout and then threw him into the valley. It thus came to be known as Keechakadara, which eventually colloquialised to Chikaldhara. There is, however, not much evidence apart from hearsay to support this argument.[citation needed]

The sole hill resort in the Vidarbha region, it is situated at an altitude of 1118 meters with highest elevation point 1188 meters and has the added dimension of being the only coffee-growing area in Maharashtra. Chikhaldara has an annual rainfall of 154cm. Temperatures vary from 39C in summer to 5C in winter. The best months to visit are from October to June.

It abounds in wildlife, such as tigers, panthers, sloth bears, sambars, wild boar, and rarely seen wild dogs. Close by is the Melghat Tiger Project which has 82 tigers.[citation needed]
