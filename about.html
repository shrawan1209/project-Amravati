                <h2>• Amravati is a historical district of Maharashtra, located in the Eastern side of Maharashtra,
                partly on the Satrupa mountain range and the rest part on the plains. Centrally located in India, 
                this is a huge district with its administrative headquarters located in the Amravati town.</h2>

                <h3>Origin of the Name</h3>
                <p>•Amravati’s existence dates back to the ancient times, when the region was known as <b>“Udumbravati” or “Umbravati.”</b>
                The present day name Amravati flowed from Umbravati, mainly due to the multiple iterations of mispronounced and misinterpretation by generations of multicultural rulers 
                of this region and their subjects.</p>
                <p> •name Udumbravati finds its precedence due to the presence of Audumber trees (Cluster Fig Tree), which are found in plenty the region. Another school of thought that is adopted by many historians is that the name Amravati permeated from the prehistoric Ambadevi temple, which is still present in this area. If legends are to be believed, this temple is considered to be build during the rule of Lord Krishna.<br/>
                 <b>The statues present in the temple scientifically date back to 1097AD,</b>which marks the beginning of a legendary era of Amravati.</b></p>

Visionary leader Subhash Chandra Bose inaugurated the Municipal A.V. High School of Amravati. He was part of the 'Savinay Awagya Andolan', which had its head office located in Amravati.  <b>The famous 'Namak Satyagraha Andolan', also gets its share of relation with Amravati. On 26th of April 1930, the water required for the Satyagraha Andolan was procured from 'Dahihanda', a small village just 73.1kms from Amravati town.</b>

               •The British Raj or Empire took administration of the Amravati district as a part of Berar Province, from the mid of the 19th century. The initial half of the century being under the rule of the Nizams, absolute power was wrested to the British Empire in the year 1859. The East India Company took over the administration of this province, dividing it into two districts of the North and the East Berar District.  The East Berar District was formed, with Amravati as its mantle of being the head quarter. Then onwards, from 1859 to 1871, British ruled with able hands.

The administration was bolstered with numerous administrative buildings being erected to govern the region of Amravati. There is still an area called the Camp in Amravati, the name of which hung ever since the British general author Wellesly set up his camp there. The first railway station came up at Amravati in 1859, followed by the commissioner bungalow in 1860. The main post office was established in 1871 and the small cause court was built in 1886.

During the year 1903, Amravati became a part of the British Central Province, finally being accorded as a district in 1905. With the independence of India, Amravati became a part of the Bombay State, before officially becoming a district of Maharashtra in 1960.
